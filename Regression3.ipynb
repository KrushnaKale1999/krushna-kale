    "### Q1. What is Ridge Regression, and how does it differ from ordinary least squares regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "#**Ridge Regression**: A linear regression technique that includes a regularization term (penalty) to shrink the coefficients towards zero to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "#The regularization term is the L2 norm (squared sum of coefficients).\n",
    "#**Difference from OLS**: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) minimizes the sum of squared residuals, while Ridge Regression adds a penalty proportional to the sum of the squares of the coefficients (λ∑β²).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. What are the assumptions of Ridge Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "#- Linearity: The relationship between the independent and dependent variables is linear.\n",
    "#- Independence: Observations are independent.\n",
    "#- Homoscedasticity: Constant variance of errors.\n",
    "#- Normality: Errors are normally distributed (especially important for small samples).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. How do you select the value of the tuning parameter (lambda) in Ridge Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "#Lambda (λ) is typically selected using cross-validation. The value that minimizes the cross-validation error is chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. Can Ridge Regression be used for feature selection? If yes, how?\n",
    "\n",
    "#Ridge Regression is not typically used for feature selection because it shrinks coefficients but does not set them exactly to zero.\n",
    "#For feature selection, Lasso Regression (which uses L1 regularization) is more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. How does the Ridge Regression model perform in the presence of multicollinearity?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#Ridge Regression performs well in the presence of multicollinearity because it adds a penalty to the size of the coefficients,\n",
    "#which helps to stabilize their values and reduce variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6. Can Ridge Regression handle both categorical and continuous independent variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "#Yes, Ridge Regression can handle both categorical and continuous independent variables. \n",
    "#Categorical variables need to be properly encoded (e.g., one-hot encoding).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7. How do you interpret the coefficients of Ridge Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "#The coefficients in Ridge Regression are interpreted similarly to OLS regression, indicating the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the predictor. \n",
    "#However, they are shrunk towards zero due to regularization, making them smaller than in OLS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q8. Can Ridge Regression be used for time-series data analysis? If yes, how?\n",
    "\n",
    "#Yes, Ridge Regression can be used for time-series data analysis. However, it is important to include lagged variables and ensure that the data is stationary.\n",
    "#Additionally, proper cross-validation techniques like time-series split should be used to avoid data leakage."
