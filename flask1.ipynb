    "# What is Flask Framework? What are the advantages of Flask Framework?\n",
    "\n",
    "#Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python. It's designed to be simple and easy to use, yet powerful enough to build complex web applications. Flask is often referred to as a \"micro\" framework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. \n",
    "# It's flexible and allows developers to choose the components they want to use for their projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Advantages of Flask Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "#1. Lightweight: Flask has minimal dependencies, making it lightweight and easy to set up. This simplicity allows for faster development and easier maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#2. Flexibility: Flask doesn't impose any particular way of doing things. Developers have the freedom to structure their applications as they see fit, choosing the libraries and components that best suit their needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#3. Extensibility: Flask provides a wide range of extensions that add extra functionality to your applications, such as authentication, database integration, and form validation. These extensions can be easily integrated into your Flask projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#4. Easy to Learn: Flask's simple and intuitive API makes it easy for developers to get started, even if they're new to web development. Its minimalistic design and clear documentation help streamline the learning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#5. Built-in Development Server: Flask comes with a built-in development server, making it easy to test your applications locally before deploying them to a production environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#6. Jinja2 Templating: Flask uses the Jinja2 templating engine, which allows for the creation of dynamic HTML content. This makes it easy to build dynamic web pages with reusable templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#7. RESTful Request Dispatching: Flask provides built-in support for RESTful request dispatching, making it easy to create RESTful APIs for your web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#8. Scalability: While Flask is lightweight, it's also scalable. It can handle large applications with ease, thanks to its modular design and support for various extensions.\n",
